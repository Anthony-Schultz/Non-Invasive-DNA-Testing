# Non-Invasive-DNA-Testing
De-identified data and R code for simulating DNA degradation due to non-invasive genetic sampling


This README will describe the different files found in this repository and their uses. 

R Script files:
There are two PDF files formatted as R Markdown vignettes containing the R coding required to simulate the reduced call rates and fewer loci typically found in genotype datasets from non-invasively sampled DNA, as well as simulate spatially-explicit population subsampling. For the context of these simulations please refer to the associated pubished paper, Schultz et al (in prep). 

.CSV files:
The four .csv files here provide de-identified data used in the our analyses. We have included this 1) for reproducibility and transparency, and 2) to provide a template for practitioners who wish to use our simulations on their own datasets.

PLEASE READ THE R SCRIPT DOCUMENTS FIRST, ALL DETAILS ARE EXPLAINED THERE.
